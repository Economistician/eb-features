# Feature Engineering

This section documents the panel feature engineering orchestration utilities
provided by **eb-features**.

These tools transform entity × timestamp panel data into model-ready feature
matrices while enforcing leakage safety, monotonic time ordering, and
deterministic feature construction.

All content below is generated automatically from NumPy-style docstrings
