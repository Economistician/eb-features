"""
Test suite for `eb_features.panel`.

This package contains unit tests covering the panel time-series feature engineering
modules (lags, rolling, calendar, encoders, validation, config, constants, and the
FeatureEngineer orchestrator).

Notes
-----
- Tests are intended to be deterministic and fast.
- They should not require network access or external data sources.
