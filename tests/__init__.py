"""
Test suite for the eb_features package.

This package contains unit tests validating correctness, stability, and edge-case
behavior across all submodules.

Notes
-----
- Tests are designed to be deterministic and fast.
- No external services or network access should be required.
- Shared fixtures live in ``tests/conftest.py`` or subpackage-specific
  ``conftest.py`` files.
